In the game, there exists a link to a PDF file found in /media where it explains how to play the game. Please refer to that for a tutorial on the game.

An important note not directly mentioned in the PDF tutorial is damage of an attack. Each attack has a particular amount of damage per hit.

Every character's stats can all be found in the characters.js file on the root. Although I do not intend to show that data, it could be of interest and useful to some people.
